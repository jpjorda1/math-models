<b>Projectile Simulator</b>

This programs takes exit velocity and launch angle and returns flight time, distance, and a plot of trajectory both with and without air resistance.

Included is an example plot modelling Elly de la Cruz's (Cincinnati Reds) home run on 7/2/2024 against the LA Dodgers. Exit velocity was 51.3 m/s, launch angle was 35 degrees. The predicted distance (132 m) and actual distance (129 m) agree to within 3%. This is possibly due to inaccuracies in the drag coefficients or possibly rounding errors in fundamental constants or conversion factors.

Next Steps
  - Include dependence of the quadratic drag coefficient on temperature and altitude
  - Include Coriolis affects and over head plots to show deflection
