#Hanging Spring

This program asks the user for mass, spring constant, and damping ratio and returns a plot of the natural frequency, natural length (provided it is well defined, and spring trajectory.

This is my first program with input validation.

Next steps include:
  - Multiple plots for multiple inputs
  - 2D or 3D oscilllator
